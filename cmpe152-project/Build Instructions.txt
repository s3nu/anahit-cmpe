Prerequisites:
antlr4 libraries are in /usr/local/lib
antlr4 header files are in /usr/local/include

If antlr4 files needed to be generated, use Clouds.g4 in src


To build compiler using cmake on command line(after cpp files are generated):

# run inside FinalCompilerDeliverables
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
cd ..

To run compiler if executable is in FinalCompilerDeliverables:
./Clouds sample_programs/Assignment7.clouds
java -jar jasmin.jar collisionengine/assignmentseven.j
javac collisionengine/*.java
java -cp .:PascalRTL.jar collisionengine/assignmentseven
