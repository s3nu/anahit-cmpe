variables are in stack
globals are in heap
you can not write flash memory
static = global memory
heap is only malloc
const int ticker - 0; // volatile
if all variables are all volitile then there is no optimization becuase volitile uses load instruction
static has mutiple meanings -- interview  quesiton

there is a process that copies vars to ram
