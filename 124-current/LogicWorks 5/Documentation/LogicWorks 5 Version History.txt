CHANGES IN VERSION 5, RELATIVE TO 4

- VHDL: LogicWorks now allows you to create simulation models using
  a subset of the VHDL hardware description language.  Please note that
  some parts of the language are not implemented in this version, so some
  VHDL models created on other systems may not run in LogicWorks without
  modification.  A separate ReadMe file provided with the package provides
  more information on the specific limitations in this version.

- Simulation values of signals can now be displayed directly on the
  schematic diagram as the simulation progresses.

- All simulation values now use real time units, e.g. nanoseconds.

- IOPnael tool allows you to display and modify simulation values and
  creae custom display panels for your models.

- Many improvements to the symbol editor tool, including the ability to
  automatically display pin names with each pin.

- TestPanel module allows you to specify a program of input values to
  apply to a circuit under test and compare the results to the expected values.

- Many small new features and improvements.
